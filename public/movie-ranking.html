<h3>Daisy</h3>
<p>Been watching this movie over 20 times both solo and with my friends. Very poetic yet nerve-racking love story/action movie.</p>

<h3>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</h3>
<p>A classic. Artisitc shooting and editing, beautiful scenes, astonishing make-up work, outstanding actors and above all, revealing life stories to provoke deep thinking about oneself.</p>

<h3>Gone with the Wind</h3>
<p>Best book to movie adaptation. Music, scenes, clothing, actors, etc. everthing is marvelous.</p>
